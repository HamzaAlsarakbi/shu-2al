# Shu 2al

Shu 2al → Shoo Ahl (ʃu ʔaːl) - شو قال - is a Levantine Arabic phrase that translates literally to "What did [he] say?".

Shu 2al is a subtitle generating and translating project. You can load a YouTube playlist, and it will download it, generate subtitles, then translate them.

All you need is a powerful GPU, some time, and patience.

## Why Rust?

Cause I hate Python (I haven't written Python in months and I'm just too lazy to get back), and because I'm just too used to the Rust ecosystem.
